    "\n",
    "This report will examine aspects of what is considered an unremarkable, if not difficult, time period for Liverpool Football Club (often referred to as LFC or LIV) and their legendary captain Steven Gerrard. The data utilized for this report ranges from the 2008-2009 season up to the 2015-2016 season. LFC came close on many occasions, but only featured limited team success, especially for such a historically decorated and respected English club. In fact, their only major trophy was a 2011-12 English Football League Cup (Carling Cup) victory over Cardiff Cup. \n",
    "\n",
    "This period saw five different managers, starting with the ending of who was then the most prolific manager of Liverpool's modern era (Rafael Benítez) and the start of a future Anfield legend's time with the Reds (Jurgen Klopp). These two bookend the horrible 7 months of Roy Hodgson, the second attempt as manager for Kenny Dalglish and the somewhat better results of Brendan Rodgers. Dalglish was at least able to bring one domestic cup victory and near success in the English Premier League(EPL). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to not speak of this time period without a negative bias. Fans watched a European Champions League winning squad slowly dissipate into something that was held together by Steven Gerrard alone for several years, at least until the financial investment during Brendan Rodgers reign. Though, despite the investment, and an unexpected title run, Brendan Rodgers time with Liverpool ended unremarkably. This is not to say that fans lost hope, but it was a bleak time.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did the club really perform compared to its title rivals? Was Steven Gearrard considered better or worse than Frank Lampard based on Fifa's analysis? This report will aim to provide those comparisons in a clear digestible manner. \n",

    "Regardless, all you Reds know how to carry on...![alt text](Miles/Dropbox/Udacity/2020/Data_Analyst/introduction_to_data_analysis/final_project_football_data/investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb/liverpool-fc.jpg \"Liverpool Crest\")\n",

    "That was one of \"The\" battles for many years in the EPL and on the English national team. Which of these two midfield greats was the best in England, Europe, the world? Well, the data we are working with covers both of them over the later years of their career, but unfortunately is a collection of FIFA attribute rankings, rather than true statistics. These rankings are not the best way to examine the career, let alone compare, these prolific midfielders, but we are atleast able to understand who was <em>assessed</em> as having the most potential and being the best overall player on a year by year basis.\n",
